Grants scraper is a simple scraping tool used to convert grant numbers into urls of main grant pages then urls of their documentation. The app then can parse the documentation for the "purpose" section and "Description" section.

The app requires an excel spreadsheet as it's input and requires an "OPPORTUNITY NUMBER" column.
