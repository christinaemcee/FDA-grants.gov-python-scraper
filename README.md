Grants scraper is a simple scraping tool used to convert grant numbers into urls of main grant pages then urls of their documentation. The app then can parse the documentation for the "purpose" section and "Description" section.

The app requires an excel spreadsheet as it's input and requires an "OPPORTUNITY NUMBER" column.


There are three formats for the grant documentation pages and there is no apparent reason for which format is used. I have defined them as type 1, 2, and 3; examples are as follows.

![Alt text](relative/path/to/img.jpg?raw=true "Title")

![Alt text](relative/path/to/img.jpg?raw=true "Title")

![Alt text](relative/path/to/img.jpg?raw=true "Title")
